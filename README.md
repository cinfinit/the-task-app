## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

I try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you .
I have targetted both frontend and backend in this project . 
I know their are some optimizations that can be put in both the ends , but i have currently designed in the way of prototype , though keeping in mind the quality 

You can go through the following commands to setup and run it locally : 
- Clone the project
- run the command " npm i " (make sure your node is greater then v16.X)
- after that run the command " npm run dev "
